#iChair

This project is meant to help mac users who spend most of the time during the day at their computer to maintain better posture. It connects to a pre-paired bluetooth module and communicates with it using a bluetooth serial port connection. When incorrect posture is detected, the Arduino Uno sends a message over bluetooth to the computer, and the computer will notify the user through a growl notification.
